# 📊 HR Dashboard Case Study: Empowering Data-Driven HR Decisions

## 🧠 Project Background
As part of a data analytics initiative, I developed a comprehensive **HR Dashboard** to help Human Resource managers visualize and analyze workforce metrics more effectively. The primary objective was to deliver **high-level summaries** and **granular employee insights** to support both **strategic planning** and **operational decisions**.

---

## 💼 Business Problem

The HR department lacked a unified, visual system for tracking and analyzing employee data. This led to:
- Fragmented reporting and slow, reactive decision-making
- Difficulty identifying trends in hiring, attrition, or underperformance
- Inability to detect salary disparities and demographic gaps
- Lack of data-driven planning for hiring, compensation, and retention

The business required a dynamic HR dashboard that could present **real-time and historical insights**, drive **data-backed decisions**, and uncover **hidden patterns**.

## 🔍 Analysis

Using a simulated employee dataset, the dashboard was built in **Tableau** and divided into four core analytical views:

### 1. **Overview**
- Total hired, active, and terminated employees
- Hiring and termination trends over time
- Distribution by department, job title, city, and HQ vs. branch comparison

### 2. **Demographics**
- Gender ratio visualization
- Age group and education level breakdown
- Correlation between education level and performance rating

### 3. **Income Analysis**
- Salary comparison by gender, education level, and department
- Correlation between age and salary by department

### 4. **Employee Records**
- Searchable, filterable table with employee details: name, department, age, gender, education, performance, salary
